### PyBank
* In this task, a Python script was created for analyzing the financial records of the company. A set of financial data called budget_data.csv was given. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. 
* A Python script was created that analyzed the records to calculate each of the following:
    * The total number of months included in the dataset
    * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

    * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
* Result:</br>

### PyPoll
* In this task, a small, rural town that was modernizing asked for help with its vote counting process.
* A set of poll data called election_data.csv was given. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. A Python script was created that analyzed the votes and calculates each of the following:
